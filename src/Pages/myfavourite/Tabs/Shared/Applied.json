    "description": "Our Spa Specialists play an important role in support of a number of vital Spa functions. At our hotels these associates work to build an experience that is memorable and unique – with Spa services on the side. Our Spa Specialists take the initiative and deliver a wide range of services to make sure that guests enjoy their experience. Whether promoting Spa services or retail, scheduling reservations and confirming appointments, providing answers about services, checking in guests, or processing payments, the Spa Specialist makes transactions feel like part of the experience. No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe workplace, following company policies and procedures, upholding quality standards, and ensuring your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Spa Specialists will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time; moving over sloping, uneven, or slippery surfaces), managing reservation software (read and visually verify information), and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 10 pounds without assistance and 25 pounds with assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Spa Specialists - to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time."
